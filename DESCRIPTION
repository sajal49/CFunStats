Description: Statistics to preserve continuity, capture
    discontinuity, and identify locality of discrete functional
    patterns. The input is discrete data of two variables. A
    corresponding contingency table is used to encode the discrete
    pattern. The output is functional statistics on a compact table
    representing the original table. Rows of the compact table are the
    trimmed and compressed version of the input table while columns
    are the same with the input table. The compact table is obtained
    by dynamic programming. Let the row variable be the independent
    variable and the column variable be the dependent variable. We
    characterize the statistical significance and the strength (effect
    size) of the pattern being a function by the model-free functional
    chi-squared test. The compact functional statistics can be applied
    to time-course signals to recognize both temporal continuity and
    discontinuity while reducing model biases.
